There are some words you should know to learn more effectively. 
Don't try to learn by heart at the same time.
You will see more time in my future article.

* **VPS (Virtual private server)**
    A virtual private server (VPS) is a virtual machine sold as a service by an Internet hosting service. A VPS runs its own copy of an operating system, and customers have superuser-level access to that operating system instance, so they can install almost any software that runs on that OS. You can read more in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server" target="_blank">here</a>

* **Dedicated Server**
    A dedicated server is exactly what it sounds like. The entire physical server is yours to use, and yours alone. Depending on whether you want it to be self-managed or managed by the hosting company, you can do pretty much anything you wish with the server.

* **Hosting**
    Hosting (also known as Web site hosting, Web hosting, and Webhosting) is the business of housing, serving, and maintaining files for one or more Web sites. 

* **Website Domain**:
    A website domain, often called a domain, is the name of the website or URL.

* **DNS (Domain Name System)**    
    DNS is an abbreviation for Domain Name System, a system for naming computers and network services that is organized into a hierarchy of domains. DNS naming is used in TCP/IP networks, such as the Internet, to locate computers and services through user-friendly names.
    
* **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**
    A content delivery network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver webpages and other Web content to a user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and a content delivery server.
    
* **IP address**
    A unique string of numbers separated by periods that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network.
    
And more ... I will update frequency.
